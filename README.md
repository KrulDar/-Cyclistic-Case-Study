This capstone project is the part of the Google Data Analytics certification program. I have been completing this program for the last few month. We explored in detail six main stages of the data analytics process (ask, prepare, process, analyse, share, & act) and practiced with most popular tools like spreadsheets, Excel, BigQuery, Tableau and R.

Here I will share all my SQL queries of the project. 

Also please consider to check the visualisations made with TABLEAU: https://public.tableau.com/views/---MyfirstcapstoneprojectinTableauGoogleDataAnalyticsCyclisticCaseStudy/Dashboard4?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

The analysis was done in Medium: XXXXXXX

Enjoy.
